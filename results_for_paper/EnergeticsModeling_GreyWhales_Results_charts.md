### Total Energetic Expenditure (*E<sub>s</sub>*)

Figure 3. Estimates of average daily energetic expenditure (Es) from
activity (MJ day-1) for each month in the first year (Phase 1). calves
per month (Phase 1), and for juveniles and single adults (Phase 2),
pregnant, and lactating females per year. Values are plotted at the
midpoint of each month. Error bars show the standard deviation around
the mean of 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations. Note: Energetic expenditure
Es values for the 6th and 10th months represent energetic expenditures
across two activity stages.

### Gross Energy Requirements

year in MJ day<sup>-1</sup>. Error bars represent SD.

#### Grey whale juveniles / adults

Figure 7. Daily gross energy requirements over the year compared to
gross daily requirements when foraging is limited to the summer season.
Foraging season spans ~154 days for juveniles and adults.

Figure 8. Estimates for gross energy requirements (GER) for pregnant,
lactating females, and others (juvenile and other adult grey whales).
Daily gross energy requirements for a full year (annual) are represented
with black circles (365 for adults/juveniles, 396 for pregnant whales,
and 293 days for lactating whales). White circles represent daily gross
energy requirements for when feeding is limited during the foraging
season. Foraging season is assumed to be ~154 days for single juveniles
(1-7 y) and adults (\> 8 y), ~153 days for pregnant females, and ~119
days for lactating females. GER for pregnant whales shown here assumes
that the GER for first the 6 months of lactation while the mother is
fasting need to be consumed the previous year, when foraging while
pregnant. GER for lactating whales shown here is the GER for the
remaining 3.6 months of lactation when the mother resumes foraging while
lactating. Error bars represent SD.

### Milk / Food Requirements

#### Grey whale calves

Figure 9. Daily milk requirements for calves. The left panel represents
milk requirements (L day<sup>-1</sup>) for calves up to 9 months (left
panel), and the right panel represents food requirements (kg of benthic
invertebrate prey day<sup>-1</sup>) for weaned calves over 9 months.

#### Grey whale juveniles and adults, including pregnant and lactating

Figure 10. Food requirements (kg day-1) of benthic invertebrate prey for
pregnant females, lactating females, and others (juveniles and other
adult grey whales) during foraging season. Foraging season is assumed to
be ~154 days for single juveniles (1-7 y) and adults (\> 8 y), ~153 days
for pregnant females, and ~119 days for lactating females. Error bars
represent SD.

Figure 11. Percentage of body weight consumed day-1 during the foraging
season for juveniles and other adults, pregnant females, and lactating
females. Foraging season is assumed to be ~154 days for single juveniles
(1-7 y) and adults (\> 8 y), ~153 days for pregnant females, and ~119
days for lactating females. Note that the y-axis does not start at 0.
Error bars represent SD.

## Sensitivity Analyses

The sensitivity analyses show that the variable contributing the highest
range of uncertainty (Â±SD) to the gross energy requirements is
*E<sub>s</sub>* or total energetic expenditure (Figure 12), and that the
variable contributing the highest range of uncertainty within the Es
calculations is *%O<sub>2</sub>* or the percentage of oxygen absorbed
(Figure 13). The pattern holds for Phase 2, pregnant, and lactating life
stages, even when additional parameters are examined for the pregnant
and lactating stages (see Appendix D).
